# eStreamer eNcore
The Cisco eStreamer client for Open Cyber Security Framework (OCSF) 

The Cisco Event Streamer (also known as eStreamer) allows you to stream System intrusion,
discovery, and connection data from Firepower Management Center or managed device (also
referred to as the eStreamer server) to external client applications.

eStreamer responds to client requests with terse, compact, binary encoded messages â€“ this
keeps it fast.

eNcore is a new all-purpose client which requests all possible events from eStreamer, parses
the binary content and outputs events in various formats to support other SIEMs.

This edition of eStreamer has been specificially tailored to provide OCSF compliant Network Activity events in both json and parquet


# Support
This is a beta version of eNcore. Before the General Availability release this will be
updated with details of paying for and receiving support.

Detailed setup instructions for the CLI are included here, the specific implementation correspondences to Microsoft Sentinel integration but the CLI is the same setup
